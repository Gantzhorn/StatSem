# StatSem

This project contains the two mandatory synopses made for the course NMAK22014U Seminar in Statistics (StatSem) at the university of Copenhagen in block one of the academic year 2023/2024. In addition it contains source code for running the simulations presented in the synopses.

## Synopsis 1

In the first synopsis I looked into the paper "Markov regression models for count time series with excess zeros: A partial likelihood approach" from 2013. The paper is written by Ming Yang, Gideon K.D. Zamba, and Joseph E. Cavanaugh and can be accesed [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1572312713000166).
In addition to a brief explanation and discussion of the paper, my synopsis contains a small simulation study that
highlights an inherent difficulty in estimation in the model. By the time of writing this README the paper has 38 citations according to Google Scholar.

## Synopsis 2

In the second synopsis I considered the paper "The linear birth–death process: an inferential retrospective" by Simon Tavaré from 2018. The paper can be accesed [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-applied-probability/article/linear-birthdeath-process-an-inferential-retrospective/52799690050C62D855EE9A10E30128DF). This paper was also explained and discussed. In my simulation study here, however, I did a much more extensive look into MLE than what was done by the author. Highlighting some of the difficulties there. By the time of writing this README the paper has 27 citations according to Google Scholar.
